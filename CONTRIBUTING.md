# Contributing To TestRelay

ðŸ™Œ Thank you for contributing and joining our mission to help companies run better technical interviews!

## Repo contents

The TestRelay Github is a monorepo of all the services needed to run a full application, these are: 

- [backend](backend) - The graphql backend service written in GO and using [hasura](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine)
- [portal](portal) - The React frontend portal for both candidates and companies
- [site](site) - The landing page and docs site

## How to contribute

The overall process for contributing to TestRelay is:

1. Check the [kanban board](https://github.com/testrelay/testrelay/projects/1) to see if there is something you'd like to work on; these are the issues we'd like to focus on in the near future. The issue labels should help you find an issue to work on.
2. Create a new issue if there's no issue for what you want to work on. Please put as much as details as you think is necessary, the use-case context is especially helpful if you'd like to receive good feedback.
3. When working on an issue please add a comment to the issue you're working on to let the rest of the community know. This is so no-one duplicates work!
4. Create a fork, commit and push to your fork. Send a pull request (PR) from your fork to this repo with the proposed change. Please include unit and integration tests where applicable.
5. We'll review your change and provide feedback.

## Development process

Working on either backend or frontend services locally normally require you to have some dependencies provisioned, both locally and in the cloud. 
You can read more about the particulars in their respective project readmes. There is also an [open ticket](https://github.com/testrelay/testrelay/issues/1#issue-1035924344)
to improve and document provisioning a local dev environment. 

In the meantime, please reach out to us on [slack](https://join.slack.com/t/newworkspace-up55834/shared_invite/zt-xtb6rzic-20b8K6yLT_trVgUEqnuYCQ) for guidance.
