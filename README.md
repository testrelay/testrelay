Modern technical interviewing platforms have two main problems:

1. They focus heavily on short algorithm challenges, which aren't anywhere close to  what the majority of engineers work on day to day
2. They're incredibly expensive

TestRelay is an attempt to solve these issues. TestRelay allows you to write your own domain specific technical tests, whilst providing the power of automated scheduling and test running. TestRelay is 100% opensource and free to use, allowing even small teams to have a robust interviewing strategy.

## Features

TestRelay comes with a ton of features out the box, here's a list of the main ones:

- **Recruitment Portal** - An easy-to-use dashboard to manage your candidates, reviewers and technical tests.
- **Version Control Your Tests** - Store your technical tests directly in version control. TestRelay automatically keeps up to date with the latest changes.
- **Scheduling Management** - TestRelay seamlessly takes care of finding a date and time for candidates to sit your technical test.  
- **Candidate Portal** - Provide candidates a simple interface for managing their upcoming test and make sure they notify you about any scheduling changes.
- **Secure Test Environments** - Automated access control to generated technical test repos.

> **Note**: TestRelay is currently in **alpha** which is a fancy way of saying... *"there will be bugs!"* You can help us fix problems quickly by: 
> 1. Opening a [Github issue](https://github.com/testrelay/testrelay/issues) detailing any bugs you find 
> 2. Contributing with development effort, see [contributing guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for more info
> 3. Giving your thoughts on how we can improve the project over on [slack](https://join.slack.com/t/newworkspace-up55834/shared_invite/zt-xtb6rzic-20b8K6yLT_trVgUEqnuYCQ)
## Get started

The quickest way to get started with TestRelay is to use the managed version at [testrelay.io](https://testrelay.io). It's completely free and takes care of any infrastructure headache.

Running a self-hosted version of TestRelay involves provisioning a number of accounts/credentials with 3rd party providers. There's an [open issue](https://github.com/testrelay/testrelay/issues/1#issue-1035924344) focused on improving documentation
and support on running a self-hosted TestRelay. In the meantime feel free to reach out to directly on [slack](https://join.slack.com/t/newworkspace-up55834/shared_invite/zt-xtb6rzic-20b8K6yLT_trVgUEqnuYCQ), we'll be happy to help you walk through the process of deploying independently.
